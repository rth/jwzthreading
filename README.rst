This is an implementation of a fast and smart algorithm for threading mail messages, as described by Jamie Zawinski at http://www.jwz.org/doc/threading.html.  Don't send problems with this code to him, though; instead please open a github issue.

This fork requires Python 2.7 or 3.3+. It is based on the JWZ implementation by A.M. Kuchling, with later contributions by F.J. Breunig, B. Gr√©goire, S. Finucane and R. Yurchak.
